# Analysing Canadian Immigration Data from UN

I explored 'Immigration to Canada from 1980 to 2013' data from United Nation's website, and found which countries have the most immigrants to Canada.

The dataset contains annual data on the flows of international migrants as recorded by the countries of destination. The data presents both inflows and outflows according to the place of birth, citizenship or place of previous / next residence both for foreigners and nationals.
